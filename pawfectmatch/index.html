          Driven by an unwavering commitment to encourage 
          adoption over purchasing, <strong>Pawfect Match</strong> has been 
          successfully operating since its launch in 2003. Our 
          platform serves as a medium for pet lovers to find their 
          forever friend, and for our rescued animals to find their 
          forever home. To achieve our vision of a world without 
          abandoned pets or stray animals, we will continue 
          working hard to provide a new home, a new family, and a 
          new beginning for every animal in our care.

              Keep up the great work Pawfect Match. 
              Your animal care products and training
